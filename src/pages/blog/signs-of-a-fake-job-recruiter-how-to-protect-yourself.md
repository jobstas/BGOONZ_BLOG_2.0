## How to spot fake Recruiters?

**These are a few indicators that a job recruiter might be a fraud:**

1. A recruiter unexpectedly gets in touch with you about a job you didn't apply for or weren't actively looking for.
2. The recruiter is unable or unable to offer specifics regarding the position, such as the name of the employer, the location of the position, or the wage range.
3. The recruiter puts pressure on you to take action right away by claiming that the position is urgent and has to be filled right away.
4. The recruiter requests personal information without explaining why or how the information will be utilized.
5. The recruiter demands upfront payment for training or services related to job placement.
6. The recruiter's email or phone number is unrelated to a reputable company or recruiting firm.

Before giving out any personal information or agreeing to cooperate with a job recruiter if you think they might be a fake, it's crucial to conduct your full research. 

To find out if a company or recruitment firm is reputable, you may do some web research on them. You can also verify if there are any complaints or cautions about the recruiter with professional associations or job boards. 

Another wise move is to follow your gut if anything seems too good to be true.
